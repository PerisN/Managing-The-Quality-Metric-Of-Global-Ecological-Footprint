# Managing-The-Quality-Metric-Of-Global-Ecological-Footprint
The global ecological metric is a measure of the health and sustainability of the planet's ecosystems. It takes into account a variety of factors such as biodiversity, water quality, and greenhouse gas emissions. Ensuring that the global ecological metric is well-managed is critical for preserving the natural world and mitigating the impacts of climate change.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop and implement strategies for managing the quality of the global ecological metric. This will involve identifying key drivers of the metric, such as habitat destruction and pollution, and implementing measures to mitigate their impacts.
